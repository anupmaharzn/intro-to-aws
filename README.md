### About cloud computing
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services, including storage, processing power, and various applications, over the internet. Instead of relying on local servers or personal devices to handle applications and store data, cloud computing allows users to access and use these resources remotely through the internet.
    
- Three main Services Model

    - Infrastructure as a service (Iaas): Networking->Storage->Servers->Virtualization.Example of Iaas (AWS,Microsoft Azure,GCP)
    - Platform as a service (Paas): Networking->Storage->Servers->Virtualization->os->middleware->runtime.Example of Paas (Heruko,Google App Engine)
    - Software as a service (Saas): Networking->Storage->Servers->Virtualization->os->middleware->runtime->Data->Application (this strucuture is also same for on-premises).Example of Saas(Dropbox,G suite,Microsoft 365)

    - Public Cloud: Services are provided over the internet and shared among multiple users.Public cloud providers make resources available to the general public or a large industry group.
    - Private cloud: Cloud resources are used exclusively by a single organization. Private clouds can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.
    - Hybrid cloud: This model combines elements of both public and private clouds.
