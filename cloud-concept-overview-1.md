# Intro to cloud (AWS)

### History
- 2-Teir Architecture
- 3-Teir Atchitecture
- virtualization (traditional , hypervisor)


### About cloud computing
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services, including storage, processing power, and various applications, over the internet. Instead of relying on local servers or personal devices to handle applications and store data, cloud computing allows users to access and use these resources remotely through the internet.
    
- Three main Services Model

    - Infrastructure as a service (Iaas): Networking->Storage->Servers->Virtualization.Example of Iaas (AWS,Microsoft Azure,GCP)
    - Platform as a service (Paas): Networking->Storage->Servers->Virtualization->os->middleware->runtime.Example of Paas (Heruko,Google App Engine)
    - Software as a service (Saas): Networking->Storage->Servers->Virtualization->os->middleware->runtime->Data->Application (this strucuture is also same for on-premises).Example of Saas(Dropbox,G suite,Microsoft 365)

### Service Model

- Three main Deployment Model

    - Public Cloud: Services are provided over the internet and shared among multiple users.Public cloud providers make resources available to the general public or a large industry group.
    - Private cloud: Cloud resources are used exclusively by a single organization. Private clouds can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider.
    - Hybrid cloud: This model combines elements of both public and private clouds. 

### Advantage of Cloud
- Cost Efficiency
- Scalibility
- Availability
- Security
- Backup and disater recovery
- Global reach


## Amazon Web Service (AWS)


### what is web services?

A web service is any piece software that makes itself available over the internet and uses a standardized format - such as extensible markup language(XML) or Javascript object Notation(JSON) - for the request and the response of an application programming interface(api) interaction.

### What is AWS?

- AWS is a secure cloud platform that offers a broad set of global cloud-based products.
- AWS provides you with on-demand access to compute,storage,network,database, and other IT resources and management tools.
- AWS offers flexiblity
- you pay only for the individual services you need for as long as you use them.
- AWS servies work together like building blocks.


### Type AWS services

![aws services](https://github.com/anupmaharzn/intro-to-aws/assets/34486226/394e37dd-ac59-4da6-a7ac-da4c722e7c82)


### Three ways to interact with AWS

- AWS management console (GUI)
- AWS CLI : access to services by discrete commands or scripts
- SDKS : Access servies directly from your code(such as node.js,java python)


### Moving to the AWS

- The AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) was created to help organization develop efficient and effective plans for their cloud adoption journey.
- The AWS CAF organizes guidance into six areas of focus called perspectives.
- Perspectives consist of sets of business or technology capabilities that are responsibility of key stakeholders.
